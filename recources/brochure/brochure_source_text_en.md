# Welcome to Monero!

Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin, which you may have heard about.
However, thanks to being developed afterwards, it has some features that make it very special. Monero is money you can receive and send over the internet.

## How does it work?

The Monero network is made of thousands of interconnected computers. Each one has a identical copy of a list. That list says who owns which coin, but instead of having people’s names, it has long **keys** made out of numbers and letters.

This way, a single person can have lots of keys, and their name is never written anywhere.
Creating one key is all that’s needed to have moneros.

## How do I get my keys?

To get keys, you just need a Monero **wallet**. There are different types of them that work on different devices, like a computer or a cellphone.

It’s better to choose one that is both **free** and **open source**. This way, we can ensure that many people use it, and that those with the knowledge to do so, can verify it works safely.

**Monerujo is a wallet** that has both characteristics.

## Download Monerujo

It’s easy, you have to open the Google Playstore on your phone and search for **Monerujo**.

You can also get it by scanning this QR code with your phone:

## Create a wallet

Open Monerujo, you’ll be welcomed by a series of onboarding screens. Pay attention, they contain important information.

Once inside, your screen won’t show any wallet, so you’ll have to create one.
To do so, touch this button [+]

You have 2 options:

A - If you want a brand new wallet that has never been used before.

1. Choose “Create new wallet”
2. Pick a name and a password you can remember. Go ahead.
3. You’ll see a screen with your wallet’s details. Write down the Mnemonic Seed very carefully. That seed is the mould you’ll use to cast all your keys. Keep it in a safe and secret place. You’re done.
4. You’ll be back at the main screen. Your newly created wallet should be there.

B - If you want to restore a wallet that you or someone else created for you before.

1. Choose “Restore wallet 25 word seed”
2. Pick a name and a password you can remember.
3. Enter the seed you already have, either one that you created before or one that someone else created for you.
4. Enter a date that you’re sure is before the creation of the wallet. For example 2015-01-01. Done.

## Get moneros!

Now that your wallet is ready, let’s see how to receive moneros in it.
Remember the keys? Monerujo can use them to create lots of addresses to receive moneros. Think of each address as a mailbox that can only be opened with your key.

1. On the main screen, touch the name of the wallet in which you want to receive the money.
2. Monerujo will ask for your password or fingerprint, depending on how you set up the wallet.
3. Once inside, you’ll see your current balance and a list of past transactions (every time you received or sent moneros). Press the [RECEIVE] button.
4. At the top, you’ll see a long chain of characters similar to this one: [MONERO ADDRESS] That’s your main Monero address. That’s what you have to give someone who wants to send you moneros so they reach you. (If you touch it, you’ll reach a screen where you can see and create more addresses. You can use any of them, they all lead to your same wallet)

5. Touch the [COPY] icon to copy your address to the clipboard and then paste on a message. If you’re close to each other you can also show the QR code displayed below to the sender, which can be scanned using another Monerujo. It works just the same.
6. Now you only have to go back and wait for them to send the money. Once they do, it should appear in your list in a couple of minutes (or less).

## Send moneros!

Now that you have moneros, you can send them to another person, pay for a product or service, or even send them to yourself (for practice!).
The keys that Monerujo stores, are the ones that allow you to authorize sending moneros from your wallet to another.

1. On the main screen, touch the name of the wallet that you want to send the money from.
2. To open the wallet, Monerujo will ask for your password or fingerprint, depending on how you set up the wallet.
3. Once inside, you’ll see your current balance (it has to be more than 0 for you to send).
	Press the [GIVE] button.


5. The first thing it’ll ask you in the following screen is the address of the receiver. You could write it, but the safest option to avoid mistakes would be to copy it from a message and paste it with the             icon.
You can also use your phone’s camera to scan it, if the receiver shows you a QR code.
6. Press AMOUNT and you’ll go to the next screen. On the top it will show your available funds. Enter how much you want to send. It will display it in XMR (moneros) by default.
7. Press CONFIRM and Monerujo will prepare your transaction.It’s going to show you three amounts:
	- What the receiver is going to get
	- The fee to pay for the sending
	- The total to be spent from your wallet
8. You only have to press [SPEND MY SWEET MONEROJ] and authorize sending with either your password or fingerprint.

## About nodes

Your wallet needs to communicate with a Monero node to be able to work. A node is one of those interconnected computers that have a copy of the transaction list.
On the top section of the main screen, you can see the node that Monerujo will try to connect to as soon as you try to use a wallet.
From time to time it may happen that a node has issues answering back, or does it too slowly. In this happens, what you have to do is touching the	icon so Monerujo cycles through known nodes to find a more responsive one. See if it changes, and try to open your wallet again.
Also, if you click on the node’s name, it will take you to a nodes screen. In case you run into problems finding new nodes, on the top right menu there’s an option called “Restore default nodes”. It will do just that.

## Important information

Just like the mnemonic seed allows you to recreate your own wallet in case you lose your phone (for example), it also allows anyone with it to do just the same, and receive and send your moneros. Please, keep it secret (so it doesn’t get stolen) and safe (so you don’t lose it).

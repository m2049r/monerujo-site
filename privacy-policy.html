                use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our
                app (monerujo: Monero Wallet).
                </p>

                <p>Personal data is any kind of data that could identify an individual.
                </p>
                <p>Monero keys and public addresses are collected and processed by the app locally
                for the purpose of processing transactions and transmitted into the Monero Network
                in encrypted form.
                </p>
                <p>Other personal data is not collected by the app.</p>
                <p>If you use the USD/EUR exchange (optional) functionality, monerujo fetches the exchange
                rate through the public API of kraken.com.
                See their privacy policy at <a href="https://www.kraken.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.kraken.com/legal/privacy</a> for
                details on how data in your requests is collected (especially the section "Information We Collect Automatically").</p>
                <p>If you use the app to pay to BTC addresses, you will be using the SideShift.ai service.
                See their privacy policy at https://sideshift.ai/ for details.
                Monerujo sends them the BTC destination address and amount. Your IP will also be collectable.</p>
